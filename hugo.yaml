    title: Tailored Software, Systems, and Language for Precision Engineering
    subtitle: Customized solutions for tubemill software, rollform systems, and advanced CAD/CAM language.
    features:
    - title: Tubemill Software
      text: Baran Southwest's Tubemill Software encompasses both Design Software and Manufacturing Software. The design systems are tailored to individual customer requirements, utilizing standard roll generating programs that are adjusted for specific needs, including dimensioning, title block insertion, and setup information. The standard tubemill system facilitates the creation, storage, and retrieval of generic mill setups that can be modified for specific customers. Additionally, design routines and criteria can be incorporated to automate mill setups based on product, material, and weld functions. Similarly, the manufacturing systems are customized for each customer, incorporating specific machining routines and post processors.

    - title: Rollform Software
      text: Baran Southwest's rollform systems, developed over the past 13 years, are off-the-shelf solutions shaped by valuable customer feedback. Despite being a standardized system, it offers operators significant flexibility in generating tooling drawings. The system provides various dimensioning styles and a choice between Metric and English units. Drawings can be produced in assembly, exploded view, or individual piece formats, with or without spacers. All drawings are generated in a standard DXF format, compatible with external CAD or CAM systems. The manufacturing systems, while generic, support multiple machining routines from the left, right, or both sides. Post processors are tailored specifically for each customer.

    - title: Custom CAD Software
      text: The programs mentioned above are crafted in our proprietary BCS CAD/CAM Language. This versatile language enables the automation of various CAD or CAM operations, encompassing standard CAD functions such as entity creation, dimensioning, geometric calculations, and utilities like Move and Rotate. Customers have the option to acquire this language, providing them the capability to develop and customize their own programs to meet specific requirements.
